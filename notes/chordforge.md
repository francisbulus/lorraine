**App idea: `ChordForge` (music improvisation skill app)**

### Platform type

- Creative arts learning and practice intelligence platform.

### What it does

- Tracks concepts like `ii-V-I resolution`, `voice-leading`, `rhythmic displacement`, `modal interchange`, and `ear-training intervals`.
- Ingests evidence from audio performances, transcription drills, and call-response prompts.
- Shows what a musician can actually apply in live improvisation (`verified`) versus what they only claim to know.

### Why it fits the engine

- There is a large gap between theory claims and real-time execution.
- Multiple modalities matter at once (hearing, playing, explaining).
- Trust decay and contested states are useful when skills get rusty or break down under tempo pressure.
