## Why "Lorraine"

Named after Lorraine Code (1937–), Canadian philosopher, Distinguished Research Professor Emerita at York University. Author of *Epistemic Responsibility* (1987).

Code argued that having adequate knowledge of the world is not just a matter of survival but one of obligation: an obligation to "know well." She positioned epistemic responsibility as the chief intellectual virtue, the one from which all other intellectual virtues radiate.

Her key contributions that directly inform this system:

- **Knowledge is process, not product.** Code moved epistemology away from static "determinate products" toward "ever-changing processes." This is the trust decay model: knowledge as something that must be maintained, not acquired once.
- **Knowledge emerges through dialogue.** Code argued that knowledge never exists as an ungrounded abstraction but emerges through dialogue between knowers situated in specific contexts. This is the conversational interface: understanding built through interaction, not delivered as content.
- **Epistemic responsibility is active.** Knowing well requires effort, attention, and ongoing commitment. It is not passive reception. This is the verification loop: the system and the learner actively working to establish and maintain trust in what is known.
- **Knowers are situated.** What someone knows depends on who they are, where they are, and what they've experienced. This is the learner model: the trust graph is personal, contextual, and never generic.

## Adjacent Thinkers

### Miranda Fricker: Epistemic Injustice (2007)

Fricker identified that people can be wronged specifically in their capacity as knowers. Two forms:

- **Testimonial injustice:** A speaker's credibility is deflated due to prejudice. In Lorraine's terms: the system must never dismiss the learner's self-assessment. When the learner says "I don't think I actually know this," the system listens, even if its model disagrees. Principle 6 (the learner decides) is an anti-epistemic-injustice constraint.
- **Hermeneutical injustice:** Someone lacks the conceptual resources to understand their own experience. In Lorraine's terms: the map must be legible. The learner must have the vocabulary to understand their own knowledge state. The trust dashboard exists to prevent hermeneutical injustice about one's own learning.

### Alvin Goldman: Social Epistemology and Reliabilism

Goldman argued that trust is rationally justified if and only if it is formed and sustained by reliable processes: processes that tend to produce accurate representations of the world. This is the `calibrate` API: the agent checking whether its own processes are reliable. If the agent's predictions don't match reality, its trust model is unreliable and must be recalibrated.

### Peter Fonagy: Epistemic Trust (developmental psychology)

Fonagy defined epistemic trust as the willingness to seek, understand, and critically evaluate new knowledge as trustworthy and relevant, potentially integrating it into one's life. This is what Lorraine tries to produce in the learner: not just knowledge, but the capacity and willingness to evaluate whether they actually know something. Epistemic agency, not just epistemic content.

### Lev Vygotsky: Zone of Proximal Development

The ZPD is the space between what a learner can do alone and what they can do with guidance. Lorraine's "knowledge frontier," concepts adjacent to verified understanding, is a computational implementation of the ZPD. The system targets this zone for all verification and exploration activities.

### Robert Wilson et al.: The 85% Rule (2019)

Empirical finding that the optimal error rate for learning is approximately 15%. Learners should succeed roughly 85% of the time. This calibrates the system's difficulty targeting across all verification modalities. Not a design principle, but an empirical constraint.

## The Core Philosophical Claim

Lorraine makes one philosophical claim that ties everything together:

**The gap between "claims to know" and "actually knows" is the most consequential unaddressed problem in education, credentialing, organizational knowledge, and anywhere else understanding matters.**

Every existing system that "verifies" understanding is actually verifying compliance: did you complete the training, pass the test, attend the briefing, sign the form. None of these answer the question "do you understand?" They answer "did you go through the motions?"

A verifiable epistemic trust engine is infrastructure for closing that gap. Not in one domain. Across all of them.
